  Kat,

    Indian Ocean.  Yep, I am putting the finishing touches on the
    Age provinces plot similar to what Gary and You did for the 
    Pacific (...except that the Indian Ocean basin is less well
    covered by ship tracks and has a rather complicated history,
    so this will be less accurate, I fear, than yours...).  It is
    based on Cande's Map as well as largely French (Royer and 
    Patriat mainly) reconstructions.  I will show it at AGU as
    part of the Shoberg and Steins poster.

    I have attached the fracture zones digitized from the Cande map.
    I intend to add a bit from Fullerton et al.'s work later, but this
    is strictly Mesozoic...When I get it all done I'll let you know
    where it is in case you wish a copy...(Cande's lineations are 
    already digitized...).

    The attached files are the fracture zones (fz.d), seafloor 
    discontinuity lineations (discons.d) and fossil ridges (fossils.d)
    from Cande's map.

    Tah.

                                                - Tom
